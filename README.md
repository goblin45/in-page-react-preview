# In Page React Preview

This mini project contains snippets that can be used to preview a react project inside a react project itself. 

If you're building an online coding platform and want to add coding with React there, copy the snippets `Preview.jsx`, `CodeEditor.jsx` and `App.jsx` and integrate + tune them with your own project. 

`./src/components/Preview.jsx` is the heart of the in page preview rendering. 

## Output 



## Dependencies 

This project is made with `@monaco-editor/react` and `typescript`. To install them in your project, run -

```bash
npm install @monaco-editor/react typescript
```

## Installation

If you want to setup this very project on your local machine, clone it and run ->

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

I hope these snippets met your requirements. ✨
